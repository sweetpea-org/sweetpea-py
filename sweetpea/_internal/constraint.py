    1. Generate intermediate vars

        Using the fresh var counter, allocate ``numTrials * num_states`` new
        vars

    2. Entangle them with block vars

        Add to the CNF queue: ``toCNF(Iff(newVar, And(levels)))``, e.g., if the
        variable ``1`` indicates ``color:red``, the var ``3`` indicates
        ``text:red``, and the var ``25`` represents ``(color:red, text:red)``,
        do ``toCNF(Iff(25, And([1, 3])))``

    3. 1 hot the *states* e.g., 1 red circle, etc

        Same as :class:`.Consistency` above, collect all the state vars that
        represent each state & enforce that only one of those states is true,

        Derivation(4, [[0, 2], [1, 3]])

    where the index of the derived level is ``4``, and ``[[0, 2], [1, 3]]`` is
    the list of dependent indices, represents the logical formula::

        4 iff (0 and 2) or (1 and 3)

    These indicies are used the get the corresponding trial variables.
    Continuing from the example in of processDerivations, the first trial is
    represented by variables ``[1-6]`` (notice this feels like an off-by-one:
    the indicies start from ``0``, but the boolean variables start from ``1``).
    So we would use the indices to map onto the vars as::

        5 iff (1 and 3) or (2 and 4)

    Then we convert to CNF directly, i.e.::

        toCNF(Iff(5, Or(And(1,3), And(2,4))))

    This is then done for all window-sizes, taking into account strides (which
    are specified only in :class:`DerivedLevels <.DerivedLevel>` specified with
    a general :class:`.Window` rather than :class:`.Transition` or
    :class:`.WithinTrial`). We grab window-sized chunks of the variables that
    represent the trials, map the variables using the indices, and then convert
    to CNF. These chunks look like::

        window1: 1  2  3  4  5  6
        window2: 7  8  9  10 11 12

    So, for the second trial (since the window size in this example is ``1``)
    it would be::

        11 iff (7 and 9) or (8 and 10)

    When a dependent_idx has `BeforeStart`, then it should only apply early
    where the corresponding level is not available.

    90% sure this is the correct way to generalize to derivations involving 2+
    levels & various windowsizes. One test is the experiment::

        color = ["r", "b", "g"];
        text = ["r", "b"];

    vars that match the same level & pair them up according to k.

    We want ``AtLeastKInARow 2 ("color", "red")``, then we need to grab all the
    vars which indicate color-red::

        [1, 7, 13, 19]

    and then wrap them up in CNF as follows::

        If(1) Then (7)          --------This is a corner case
        If(And(!1, 7)) Then (13)
        If(And(!7, 13)) Then (19)
        If(19) Then (13)   --------This is a corner case

    If it had been ``AtLeastKInARow 3 ("color", "red")``, the CNF would have
    been::

        If(1) Then (7, 13)          --------This is a corner case
        If(And(!1, 7)) Then (13, 19)
