    # TODO: There is probably a way to make this smoother. As it stands,

    #: The factor to which this level belongs.
    factor: Factor = field(init=False, repr=False)

    # NOTE: Because of the way dataclasses work, a base class (e.g., `Level`)
    #       cannot provide an attribute with a default value if a subclass
    #       (e.g., `DerivedLevel`) provides additional non-default values. This
    #       means the base class cannot provide a `weight` field with a default
    #       value of `1`, which is what we want to achieve. (Additionally,
    #       we'd prefer the `weight` to always be the last field of a level's
    #       initialization parameters.)
    #           The solution is to have the base class implement a hidden
    #       attribute, and provide access to it via a `@property`. Then, the
    #       child classes must add a `weight` `InitVar` field with a default
    #       value after their other fields, and use the `__post_init__` to set

    """An independent variable in a factorial experiment. Factors are composed
    of :class:`Levels <.Level>` and come in two flavors:

    - :class:`.SimpleFactor`
    - :class:`.DerivedFactor`

    However, both classes can be implicitly constructed by the base
    :class:`.Factor` constructor, so we recommend you always use that for
    creating factors.

    During :class:`.Factor` construction, the first :class:`.Level` in the
    :attr:`~.Factor.initial_levels` is dynamically type-checked. If it's a
    :class:`.DerivedLevel` or :class:`.ElseLevel`, a :class:`.DerivedFactor` will be
    initialized. Otherwise, a :class:`.SimpleFactor` will be initialized.

    In all cases, the :attr:`~.Factor.initial_levels` will be processed. This
    step ensures that all of a factor's :attr:`~.Factor.levels` will always be
    :class:`Levels <.Level>`. The levels are processed according to these
    rules:

    1. A :class:`.Level` instance is left alone.

    2. A :class:`str` instance is converted into a :class:`.SimpleLevel`.

    3. A :class:`tuple` or :class:`list` consisting of exactly one :class:`str`
       followed by one :class:`int` will be converted into a
       :class:`.SimpleLevel` with the :class:`str` as its name and the
       :class:`int` as its weight.

    4. Anything else is converted into a :class:`.SimpleLevel` by using it
       as a level name.
