SweetPea API Documentation
==========================

This is the technical documentation for the :mod:`sweetpea` Python package,
which provides the implementation of the :ref:`SweetPea language <home>`.


.. NOTE: We start at _apidoc/sweetpea instead of _apidoc/modules because we
   only provide a single module, so having a higher-level organizational page
   isn't very helpful.
